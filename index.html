        <h2>Computer Science Student</h2>

        <p>I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Florida State Universtiy. Coursework has included;
           Algorithm Analysis, Programming Languages, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Theory and Structures of Database Design,
           Expert Systems, Programming fundamentals with C++, Internet Programming with Java, and Mobile Development with Android Studio.
           I am also utilizing the Lynda.com turorials to learn FullStack web development. This website is my web project for that endeavor,
           and will therefore be under constant construction.
           I will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript initially and primarily, but will add other technologies as I encounter them.</p>
           <p>At the moment, I am seeking a full or part time position that will enable me to expand my skillset as well as strengthen
           skills I already possess. This can be a permenant opportunity or an intern position. There is no substitute for getting your
           hands dirty with real world expieriences.</p>
